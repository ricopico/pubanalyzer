# pubanalyzer

This is the PubAnalyzer project, as part of IST 510 Computational Informatics w/ Dr. Prasenjit Mitra.

It is developed and managed by Prasanna Umar and Richard Caneba.

What this does is format Publish or Perish output for publication analysis, and cleans it, then can output it in various forms (still in development).

Additional features to be added in the near future.

Feel free to fork if you'd like!  Just don't push garbage to the master branch.
